    "been tracking an emerging shift in how online communities handle expertise - moving away from traditional credentialing toward proof-of-work portfolios. seeing this bubble up in tech, creative, and even academic spaces. feels like we're witnessing the early days of a major change in how we value and verify knowledge."
